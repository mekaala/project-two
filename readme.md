I could do a mobile coding application that syncs with the computer?
...
no... that would be too difficult in a short time.

What kind of application should I make?
A photography database, showing off different locations within Atlanta for photography? - Thanks Isabel
Show which places you can photograph, and which ones you cannot.
Sort locations by area OR by environment.
Display photographs detailing my work.
Use as a sort of photography portfolio?
